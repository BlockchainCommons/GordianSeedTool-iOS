# About Gordian Seed Tool

**Gordian Seed Tool** is open-source software that is a project of [Blockchain Commons](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/). It was created to allow the offline creation and storage of seeds for use primarily with cryptocurrencies. It allows you to create robust seeds by a variety of means (or to import seeds from other sources), to store those seeds in a secure manner, and to easily export your seeds or their key derivations when you're ready to use them. Note that it is not a Wallet, simply an accessory to support your safe use of other Cryptocurrency applications

**Gordian Seed Tool** demonstrates the Gordian principles. It allows you to maintain control of your own key material (independence), stores them on your closely held mobile device (privacy), protects them with 2FA and biometrics (resilience), and communicates via QRs and URs (openness).

Creating reference applications of this sort supports the goals of Blockchain Commons, to enable responsible key management and to support self-sovereign solutions. Blockchain Commons is a “not-for-profit” social benefit corp committed to open source and open development.
