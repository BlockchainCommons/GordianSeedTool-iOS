**Gordian Seed Tool** protects your cryptographic seeds while also making them available for easy use. Using Seed Tool, you can generate seeds and store them securely on your device. You can then derive and share multi-signature signing and verification keys from those seeds. Sophisticated backup procedures include printed pages and Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction ([SSKR](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/README.md#sharded-secret-key-reconstruction-sskr)) â€” which lets you split your seed into pieces and send them to trusted parties, who can send them back to you in an emergency for seed recovery. You can even use an entirely offline device (no internet access) to store your seeds and use QR codes to exchange necessary information with online devices running compatible wallet or signing software.

To compile from source, simply choose "Code > Open with Xcode" from the top of the repo. This will download the code into Xcode, including all of the dependencies. After you will be able to _Run_ (command-R) it for your Mac or a connected iOS device.

## Usage Instructions

* [**Manual**](Docs/MANUAL.md). An overview of installing and using **Seed Tool**, including info on adding seeds, storing seeds, using seeds, exporting seeds, and removing seeds.
* [**Integrating Seed Tool with Other Apps**](Docs/Integration.md). Using **Seed Tool** as a real-life seedstore for live transactions coordinated by other apps.
  
## Gordian Principles

**Gordian Seed Tool** is a reference implementation meant to display the [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles), which are philosophical and technical underpinnings to Blockchain Commons' Gordian technology. This includes:

* **Independence.** Seed Tool allows you to maintain personal control of your cryptographic key material.
* **Privacy.** Seed Tool ensures your privacy because everything is on your closely held mobile device.
* **Resilience.** Seed Tool uses 2FA by combining an Apple login with biometric authentication. It securely backs up your material to iCloud.
* **Openness.** Seed Tool communicates through airgaps via URs and QRs, for maximum interoperability.

Blockchain Commons apps do not phone home and do not run ads. Some are available through various app stores; all are available in our code repositories for your usage.

# Status - Released (1.2)

**Gordian Seedtool** has been released through the [Apple Appstore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229).

## Version History

[Join the Test Flight Open Beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/0LIl6H1h)

### 1.3 (42), December 15, 2021

* This is a final release candidate.
* PSBT Signing: The option to return a mock ur:crypto-response when signing a bare PSBT is now hidden unless "Show Developer Functions" is turned on in Settings.

### 1.3 (41), December 8, 2021

* Key Export: Master keys derived from seeds can now be exported to Output Descriptors (`crypto-output`) or Account Descriptors (`crypto-account`).
* To see this new feature, 1) choose a seed from the Seed List, 2) In the Encrypted Data section, tap Authenticate, 3) Tap Derive Key and then Other Key Derivations, 4) In the Parameters area, make sure Bitcoin and Master Key are selected, 5) Scroll down to the Secondary Derivation section and choose Output Descriptor or Account Descriptor. 6) Choose Output Descriptor or Account Descriptor, and edit the Account Number field if desired. 7) If you chose Output Descriptor, then choose an Output Type. 8) Scroll down to the bottom to export your Output Descriptor or Account Descriptor.
* Output Descriptors may be exported as text format or `ur:crypto-output` format. Account Descriptors may be exported in `ur:crypto-account` format.

### 1.3 (40), November 25, 2021

* Scan view: added camera selector button for front/back cameras (iOS) and built-in/desktop webcam (macOS).
* First Mac Catalyst Release

### 1.3 (38), November 18, 2021

* PSBTs containing Taproot bech32m addresses are now displayed correctly.
* Reading UR QR codes is now tolerant of QR codes that have content beginning or ending with whitespace. UR QR codes should not include whitespace like trailing carriage returns, and should be translated to upper case, because failing to do so causes QR code encoders to fall back to the less-efficient binary encoding mode resulting in unnecessarily dense QR codes. Previously Seed Tool would reject QR codes that begin or end with whitespace, but now accepts them.
* Scanning now falls back gracefully when unavailable due to running in the simulator.
* Scanning now provides diagnostic messages when the camera cannot be accessed due to system settings permissions.
* All methods of importing text data including URs and Base64-encoded PSBTs are now tolerant of strings that start or end with whitespace.
* Importing PSBT files encoded as binary or Base64 is now supported.
* Importing and exporting ur:crypto-seed and ur:crypto-sskr to and from files and the clipboard is now supported. 
* When importing text from a file or the clipboard, the text may contain any number of URs on separate lines. Non-UR lines are ignored as comments. For example, all the shares of an SSKR may be pasted at one time or imported from a single text file. Currently this is only useful for SSKRs, as a block of text containing multiple ur:crypto-seeds will only import the first one.

### 1.3 (37), November 15, 2021

* Improved support for various PSBT formats.
    * Importing a PSBT for signing may now be done from the camera for ur:crypto-request and ur:crypto-psbt, or the clipboard for Base64-encoded PSBTs, or from a file for binary `.psbt` files.
    * Exporting a signed PSBT may now be done in several formats: ur:crypto-response, ur:crypto-psbt, Base64-encoded PSBT, or binary `.psbt` file. All of these formats may use the share sheet, allowing (for example) Copy to Clipboard, *except* for binary `.psbt` files, which must be saved to the file system. The two UR formats can be displayed as (possibly animating) QR codes.

### 1.3 (36), November 10, 2021

* To increase compatibility with certain QR code readers, made all displayed QR codes black on white, even in dark mode.
* Fixed: When "Erase All Data" in Settings is used, the Undo buffer may still be used to recover the last-deleted seed. The undo buffer is now invalidated when Settings is accessed.
* Clarified explanation of how the "Erase All Data" in Settings interacts with iCloud. 

### 1.3 (35), November 9, 2021

* Fixed: QR code for crypto-response was displayed where QR code for crypto-psbt should have been displayed.

### 1.3 (34), November 9, 2021

* Fixed a couple potential crashes during PSBT signing.

### 1.3 (33), November 5, 2021

* For compatibility testing with third-party wallets that have already implemented this, a bare `ur:crypto-psbt` may now be scanned and signed. Using `ur:crypto-request` is Blockchain Commons' recommended method for requesting PSBT signing, so when a bare `ur:crypto-psbt` is scanned, users are notified of this, thus this capability should be used only for developer compatibility testing and developers are encourage to adopt `ur:crypto-request` as soon as possible. 
* When a `ur:crypto-psbt` is scanned, two possible outputs are offered: the signed bare `ur:crypto-psbt` and a dummy `ur:crypto-response`. This is a "dummy" response because it is not actually a response to a particular `ur:crypto-request` and thus the transaction ID included in the response is random and does not correspond to any actual prior request.
* Two new example QR codes have been added to the [Testing](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/tree/master/Testing) folder: `Bare PSBT 1 of 2.png` and `Bare PSBT 2 of 2.png` which can be used to test the bare PSBT signing capability. These are the same transactions also provided in `ur:crypto-request` form.

### 1.3 (32), October 13, 2021

* The minimum OS version requirement is now iOS 15. This build is only available for iOS, but a future build will be compatible with macOS 12 (Monterey).
* Seed Tool now supports signing PSBTs scanned via the camera option. When a ur:crypto-request for PSBT signing is scanned, Seed Tool will attempt to find seeds that it is managing from which it can derive keys to sign the transaction's inputs. A confirmation screen is then displayed showing the details of the transaction. If the user approves, a ur:crypto-response is displayed. The [Testing](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/tree/master/Testing) folder contains two sample testnet multisig transactions along with the seeds "Alice" and "Bob" that can be used to sign them.
 
### 1.2.1 (31), September 19, 2021 (Latest released version)

* Better Ethereum Support: The Settings View now has a "Primary Asset" switch that can be changed between Bitcoin and Ethereum. When Ethereum is selected, the following changes apply: 1) In the Seed Detail view, the green "Cosigner Public Key" changes to "Ethereum Address" for quick export of the Ethereum Address derived from the seed. 2) After clicking "Authenticate," the "Derive Key" popup has an item that changes from "Cosigner Private Key" to "Ethereum Private Key." 3) In the "Other Key Derivations" view, the default derivation path for Ethereum is now `44'/60'/0'/0/0` which is compatible with many existing wallets. 4) The bottom of the "Other Key Derivations" view now contains an "Address" box for exporting the Bitcoin or Ethereum address. 5) In the "Other Key Derivations" view, when deriving Ethereum, a new "Private Key" box appears that can be used to export the Ethereum private key. When printed, this page also includes the Ethereum address. 6) All visual hashes (identicons) associated with Ethereum keys or addresses now use "Blockies", which is widely recognized in the Ethereum world, instead of the usual LifeHash algorithm.

### 1.2.1 (30), September 12, 2021

* Fixed a bug where the layout when printing a seed would overflow the page margins or cause certain fields like the ByteWords or BIP-39 mnemonics to be truncated.

### 1.2 (29), August 20, 2021

* In the Key Detail view, an info button has been added next to the Derive Key button.
* Other than the above, this build has no new features, but does include the latest BCLibsSwift, which in turn contains the latest bc-shamir and bc-sskr, which have been reviewed and hardened for security issues. It also has been partly refactored, with some generally useful code being moved into a reusable package. These refactorings should not change the app functionally at all. Nonetheless, it should be thoroughly tested to ensure that nothing has been broken in the refactoring process.

### 1.2 (28), August 17, 2021

* An intermittent crashing bug when creating a new seed has (probably) been fixed and should be thoroughly tested. #83
* When setting up a new seed, the coaching text at the top has been changed to: "You may change the name of this seed or enter notes before saving." #82
* In the settings panel, when turning on and off iCloud syncing, a small graphical glitch in the coaching text has been fixed. #81
* Fixed typo in the "What is Key Derivation?" User Guide chapter. #80
* In the Key Export view, changed section titles "(Private|Public) Key" to be "(Private|Public) HD Key". #78
* In the Seed Detail view, fixed a case where narrow screens like iPod Touch would show wrapped or truncated buttons after authenticating.

### 1.2 (27), August 12, 2021

* Key Derivation Parameters now includes several presets including Master Key, Cosigner, and Segwit. Each preset shows the corresponding derivation path, which updates correctly depending on whether Mainnet or Testnet is selected.
* When the Segwit derivation is used, keys exported as Base58 are now prefixed with `zpub`/`zprv` (Mainnet) or `vpub`/`vprv` (Testnet).
* Key Derivation Parameters now includes a "Custom Derivation Path" field, into which users can enter any specific derivation BIP-32 path for the keys.
* Added two new section to the User's Guide: "What is BIP-39?" and "What is Key Derivation?", along with Info buttons for them at appropriate places in the interface.

### 1.2 (26), July 28, 2021

* In the Export SSKR display, removed export individual shares views. Since the SSKR generated is ephemeral, it wasn't really useful to conditionally show each one. You can now only share or print all the generated shares at once.
* The last preset in the SSKR export display is now called, "2 of 3 shares, of two of three groups".
* In the Derive Key view, both the private and public keys are now simulatenously derived, so a separate parameter for Key Type (i.e., private or public) is no longer necessary.
* In the Derive Key view, selecting Ethereum as the asset type now only allows master key derivations.
* In the Derive Key view, the share buttons for the derived public and private keys are no longer popup menus: they take you directly the the Key Export view, which shows all the export options including the QR code, print button, share as Base58. If Developer Functions are turned on in Settings, then buttons to show sample requests and responses are also visible here.
* The Share as Base58 function in the Key Export view now includes the master key fingerprint and derivation path along with the Base-58 key.

### 1.2 (25), July 27, 2021

This is a preview testing release of what will become version 1.2. It does not yet include the full set of planned features to be release with 1.2.

* You can now navigate from various places of the app to specific pages of the built-in user's guide via the â“˜ buttons.
* The Settings panel now contains a Show Developer Functions switch that shows the "Show Request/Response for this Seed/Key" options at appropriate places in the app.
* All functions that copied data to the clipboard, including long presses on QR codes, life hashes, and other static fields, now invoke the system share sheet instead. The downside to this is that the "Copy" function in the share sheet does not automatically expire the clipboard contents after a minute. It *might* be possible to add this as an app-specific function in the share sheet.
* In the Seed Detail view, the "Data" section has been renamed "Encrypted Data", and the "Decrypt" button is now called "Authenticate". It now reveals several buttons: Backup, Share, and Derive Key, which are menus that lead to futher functionality. There are also links to the documentation. This was done to make the many functions that authentication reveals more discoverable and intuitive. 
* The SSKR export view now includes a "preset selector" that lets users choose among comon sharding configurations. Users can still choose any configuration they like and this will be reflected in the preset selector as "custom".
* The "Next" button in the SSKR Export view has been moved from the bottom of the form to the top right of the view.
* All "Done" buttons are now consistently in the upper-right corner of their views.
* In the Settings panel, the default network is now "mainnet". This will only apply to users who have not manually changed this setting. 
* "Allows Further Derivation" has been removed from Key Export parameters, as it's an advanced feature not likely to be used by many users, and leaving it in was causing confusion.
* Fixed: Text in SSKR heads-up display in Scan View should always be white. Currently it is black when the phone is not in Dark Mode.

### 1.1 (24), July 13, 2021

* More detailed diagnostic messages when pasting SSKR fails.
* Scan view can now pick image(s) from document picker or photos picker.
* Added textual UR to Seed, HDKey, and SSKR print pages.

### 1.0.1 (23), July 7, 2021

* Added support on the macOS version for Print to PDF.

### 1.0.1 (22), July 7, 2021

* Fixed issues [#59](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/issues/59), [#60](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/issues/60), [#62](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/issues/62)
