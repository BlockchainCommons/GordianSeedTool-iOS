# Gordian Seed Tool Manual

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/master/images/st-listing.jpeg"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/master/images/st-listing.jpeg" align="right" width=250 style="border:1px solid black;"></a>

**Gordian Seed Tool** is an iOS and macOS seed manager that is a reference app for the Gordian system. It allows you to safely and securely store your cryptographic seeds and to derive and export public and private keys for Bitcoin and private keys and addresses for Ethereum. You can also backup or export the seed itself in a variety of forms, including as SSKR shares.

Why use **Seed Tool**? Because storing your seeds in the unecrypted RAM of a fully networked device is a major security vulnerability that also leaves your seeds vulnerable to loss. **Seed Tool** resolves both of these problems. You can move selected public and private keys online only as they're required, and you can be sure that your seeds are in a secure vault that's backed up and not dependent on a single device.

**Usability Features:**

* Import via QR or a variety of text specifications.
* Export via QR or Clipboard or printing.
* View & identify unique seeds using [Object Identity Blocks](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-002-digest.md#object-identity-block).
 
**Security Features:**

* Stored Securely with Apple Encryption.
* Protected via 2FA: you must login in to your Apple account, then you must verify whenever you access private data.
* Automated iCloud backup and recovery.
* Optionally usable offline, not connected to any network.

**Gordian Seed Tool** is a reference app, demonstrating the [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS#gordian-principles) of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness.

## Installing Seed Tool

You can either purchase **Gordian Seed Tool** from the Apple store or you can compile from the source <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/tags">using the newest release tag</a>.

For full functionality of the iCloud backup, be sure to turn on the following functionality under "Settings > Apple ID > iCloud" on all devices running **Gordian Seed Tool**:

* Keychain
* iCloud Drive

Be _very_ sure that all devices running **Gordian Seed Tool** are fully logged into your Apple account, with full access to iCloud, and switches set as noted above. Failure to do so will result in seed entries not being synced to the iCloud (or other devices).

Conversely, if you want to use Seed Tool on a network-isolated device, make sure the device is in Airplane Mode.

## Using Seed Tool

**Gordian Seed Tool** is a storage mechanism for seeds, particularly those used in cryptography systems. Seeds used in it will usually follow a three-part cycle.

1. **Add a Seed.** First, you must add seeds to the system. There are two ways to do so.
   * **Import a Seed.** You can import an existing seed that you generated in a cryptowallet.
   * **Create a Seed.** You can create a new seed.
2. **Store a Seed.** Your seed will be encrypted (and also backed up if you have iCloud enabled).
   * **View & Edit a Seed.** While you are storing a seed, you will be able to view it and change its metadata.
   * **Read an OIB.** Each seed (and key) comes with an Identity Block that makes it easy to identify.
3. **Use a Seed.** You can actively use a seed that is stored in **Gordian Seed Tool** without ever having to export it. 
   * **Answer Requests.** Seed Tool uses the [`crypto-request`/`crypto-response`](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-001-request.md) system defined by Blockchain Commons for URs. This allows Seed Tool to export precisely what's needed by another app.
   * **Derive a Key.** Alternatively, you can choose to export specific derived keys on your own, while keeping the seed in the app.
   * **Shard a Seed.** Finally, you can improve the resilience of your seed by sharding it with SSKR and giving out those shares.

The philosophy of **Gordian Seed Tool** is that once you've imported a seed you shouldn't need to ever export it. Nonetheless, you sometimes must in the modern-day, and that's supported by the following functions:

4. **Export a Seed.** You can export seeds using a variety of interoperable specifications.
5. **Delete a Seed.** You can also just delete a seed.

In the future we expect that more wallets will be able to participate with **Seed Tool** in a request/response cycle, particularly for derived child keys, and that **Seed Tool** will even be able to sign PSBTs with its seeds based on requests.

The main functionality of **Seed Tool** is laid out in this manual to demonstrate its integration with Bitcoin, but **Seed Tool** also works with Ethereum, which causes some slight variations in functionality as explained in "Integrating with Ethereum".

### Viewing the Main Menu

<blockquote>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/master/images/st-bar.jpg" align="center" width=500>
</blockquote>

The main menu contains three buttons in the menu bar along the top:

* **Information** (circled "i"). Read documentation on all of the specifications and data types found in **Seed Tool**. (Info buttons linnking to specific questions are also available throughout the app.)
* **Scan** (qr code). Import a seed (see "Importing a Seed") or a `crypto-request` (see "Using a Seed") from a QR code; or import text from the Clipboard.
* **Settings** (gear). Change major ways in which the App works.

Under the main menu are options to **add** ("+") and **delete** ("edit") seeds followed by a list of each of your seeds, with each seed identified by an Object identity Block ("OID"). You can click the right arrow on a seed to see more data about it and to export it.

### Adjusting Settings

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/master/images/st-settings.jpeg"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/master/images/st-settings.jpeg" align="right" width=250></a>

The Settings page has five major options:

* **Default Network**. Choose "MainNet" or "TestNet". This will be used for key derivation, especially as the network for the default "Cosigner Public Key" and "Cosigner Private Key" options. (Default: MainNet.)
* **Primary Asset**. Choose "Bitcoin" or "Ethereum". This will be used for address generation and key derivation. (Default: Bitcoin)
* **Sync to iCloud**. Choose "On" or "Off". If "On", this will export your keys to your iCloud account, protected by a local encryption key. This ensures that you can restore your seeds to a new device if you lose your current one. (Default: On.)
* **Show Developer Function.** Choose to switch on or off. If "On", this will show you example requests, responses, and other features of interest to developers. See "Viewing Developer Options". (Default: Off.)
* **Erase All Data.** Click to erase all data, including data on your local device and in iCloud. Be very certain you want to do this!

> :warning: **WARNING:** We highly suggest you leave iCloud backups on. Without it, if you lose your phone, you will lose all of your seeds. The iCloud backups are encrypted, so no one but you should be able to access them.

> :warning: **WARNING:** Deleting your seeds through the Settings function of "Erase All Data" will entirely remove them: they will be gone!

## Adding a Seed

Seeds can be created or imported. Seed Creation is done through the **add** ("+") button, while seed importing is done via either the Scan button (which imports via camera or other automated means) or the **add** button (which does so via cut-and-pasting).

### Scanning a Seed via Automated Means

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/master/images/st-scan.jpeg"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/master/images/st-scan.jpeg" align="right" width=250></a>

The **Scan** (qr code) button on the main menu provides the most automated methods for importing seeds, using your camera, the cut-and-paste clipboard, the file system, or your photo roll. 

To scan a QR code, you can either point your camera at the QR of a seed, import a QR of a seed from your Photos, or choose an image of a QR from your Files. 

To scan text defining a seed, just copy it into your Clipboard and click Paste. 

Note that for these methodologies, **Seed Tool** expects the QR code or the clipboard to contain a [Uniform Resource](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md), a standardized way to encode data in an efficient and self-identifying way. This will usually mean a [`ur:crypto-seed`](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-006-urtypes.md#cryptographic-seed-crypto-seed).

Besides using the scan page to import seeds, you can also use it to import SSKR shares (See "Importing SSKR Shares") or to respond to a `ur:crypto-request` (see "Answering Requests"), as described below.

### Importing a Seed via Cut and Paste

The **add** ("+") button below the main menu gives a number of options for creating seeds in **Seed Tool**, but it also lets you input text as hex bytes, [`ur:crypto-seed`](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-006-urtypes.md#cryptographic-seed-crypto-seed), [Bytewords](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-012-bytewords.md), or [BIP39 Mnemonic Words](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki). In each case, you just type or paste the words, and then click "Done".

The following show examples of the data you might input for each data type:

* **Hex Bytes:** 59F2293A5BCE7D4DE59E71B4207AC5D2
* **`ur:crypto-seed`:** `ur:crypto-seed/oyadgdhkwzdtfthptokigtvwnnjsqzcxknsktdhpyljeda`
* **Bytewords:** hawk whiz diet fact help taco kiwi gift view noon jugs quiz crux kiln silk tied omit keno lung jade
* **BIP 39 Mnemonic Words:** fly mule excess resource treat plunge nose soda reflect adult ramp planet

Again, you can also add SSKR shares, as described below.

### Importing SSKR Shares

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/master/images/st-sskr-import.jpeg"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/master/images/st-sskr-import.jpeg" align="right" width=250></a>

SSKR stands for Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction, a Blockchain Commons [specification](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-011-sskr.md). It allows you to shard a secret (such as a seed) into a number of shares, and then reconstruct the secret from some number (threshold) of those seeds that's typically fewer than all of them. For example, you might shard a seed into three shares with a threshold of two. SSKR shares can be used in one of two ways:

***Self-sovereign key recovery.*** You store shares in multiple, safe places, such as: in [QR Tool](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/projects/Releasing-QRTool/), in your safety deposit box, in your home-office safe, and in a locked drawer at work. 

***Social key recovery.*** You give out keys to friends and family who are physically separated and who store them securely.

In either case, if a seed is lost, a threshold of shares can be collected (either on one's own or from friends family) to reconstruct the seed.

**Gordian Seed Tool** can be used to collect together shares and reconstruct your seed. There are currently three ways to do so:

* **Scan: QRs.** Photograph QRs of SSKR shares until you have a threshold.
* **Scan: Paste Crypto-SSKR.** Paste `ur:crypto-sskr` of SSKR shares until you have a threshold.
* **Add: Shares.** Simultaneouly paste sufficient shares into the "add" box to meet a threshold

The `ur:crypto-sskr` specification, which can be used in the `Add` section, in the `Scan: Paste`, or encoded as a QR, look like this:

* ur:crypto-sskr/gobnbdaeadaevdbkclhseeehtldedikgpysoenreceeeeorofrwn
* ur:crypto-sskr/gobnbdaeadadrkhesefhjzdycypduokkjejponsayabguymwwnwz

The SSKR words, which can only be used in the `Add` section, look like this:

* tuna acid epic gyro gray tent able acid able frog cusp heat poem owls undo holy rich monk zaps cost brag loud fair dice idle skew iris beta tied
* tuna acid epic gyro gray tent able acid acid diet fact gala numb leaf fish toys kite cyan inky help keep heat inky song trip bulb flap yoga jazz

The **Scan** functionality is currently the more advanced of the two options, and so is the suggested methodology. It will allow you to photograph or paste individual shares, and will alert you to how many more are needed to meet the threshold and reconstruct the seed.

### Creating a Seed

**Gordian Seed Tool** can also be used to create new seeds. This is doing using the **add** (+) button on the main menu. There are four ways to do so:

* **Quick Create.** Depend on your mobile device's randomization to create a seed.
* **Coin Flips.** Flip coins and enter results.
* **Die Rolls.** Roll six-sided dice and enter results.
* **Card Draws.** Draw cards and enter results. (Be sure to replace cards and reshuffle as you draw, for the entropy calculation to be correct.)

The easiest of these methods is certainly the "Quick Create", but in that case you are depending on the randomization of your mobile device, and if there is ever an exploit revealed, you'll be forced to sweep all of your funds. Using coin flips, die rolls, or playing cards is perhaps more likely to create good entropy, and is less likely to have an exploit revealed, but you _must_ properly flip every coin, roll every die, or draw every card, no matter how tedious it is, and you must wait until you have at least 128 bits of entropy, which is considered "Very Strong". If you are not willing to do this, you should just "Quick Create" instead. Once you have a "Very Strong" amount of entropy, you should click the "Done" button, and then you'll be given the opportunity to "Save" your new seed.

The coin flipping, die rolling, and card drawing methods all have three buttons at the bottom, which allow you to: erase one entry (back arrow); use the randomizer to add one entry (a die with a "1"); or use the randomizer to add all of the entries (a die with an "all").

The usage of coin (binary) and die entropy in **Gordian Seed Tool** matches that of [**Ian Coleman's BIP-39 Mnemonic Code Converter**](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/), so you can check the results there if you want to be sure of a new seed you've created. Our card draw technique is not identical to his.

## Viewing a Seed

Once you have a seed in **Gordian Seed Tool** it will be safely encrypted, and it will be securely backed up to iCloud as long as you've enabled iCloud's access to Keychain and iCloud Drive: all devices logged into the same iCloud account will show the same seeds.

### Displaying & Editing a Seed

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/master/images/st-view.jpeg"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/master/images/st-view.jpeg" align="right" width=250 style="border:1px solid black;"></a>

You can view additional details of a seed by clicking the seed on the main menu.  The resulting page will show you the OIB, the bit size, the resultant strength, and the creation date. You can also edit the "Name" and add "Notes".

This is also where you export information on the seed, either the public key, the private data, or the seed itself, as described in "Using a Seed" and "Exporting a Seed".

### Reading the OIB

Each seed is displayed with an [Object Identity Block (OIB)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-002-digest.md#object-identity-block), which can be seen on both the listing and view pages. It helps you to visually identify a seed.

An OIB contains the following elements:

* **Lifehash.** A [methodology](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHash) for creating an evocative visual representation of data based on Conway's Game of Life. It makes it easy to recognize a seed at a glance.
* **Type.** An icon representing the type of data. On the listings and main views, this is a seed icon.
* **Name.** A human-readable name for the seed. As a default, **Seed Tool** chooses a one-or-two word phrase based on the dominant color of the Lifehash followed by two random Bytewords. When you edit a Name you can click the "die" icon to re-randomize those last two words.
* **Digest.** An abbreviated six-character digest of the seed.

The lifehash, the type, the digest, and all but the last two words in the default name should be identical anywhere that you import your seed that uses the Blockchain Commons OIB specification. That will help you to always know that your seed was accurately transmitted, and to always make sure you're working with the right seed.

OIBs are also displayed for various keys derived from your seed. They use different icons for the "type" and do not include a name, as seen in "Deriving a Key".

### Viewing Developer Functions

**Seed Tool** is an exemplar reference tool that is fully functional as a seed vault that can support responsible seed usage. It also provides functions to make it easier for developers to create apps of their own that embody the Gordian Principles. You can choose to enable this by selecting "Show Developer Functions" in the Settings.

There are currently three developer functions:

* **Show Example Request for this Seed.** Displays a `ur:crypto-request` that will request this seed. Available from the Seed view page.
* **Show Example Response for this Seed.** Displays a `ur:crypto-response` that answers a requests for this seed. Available from the "Encryped Data" area of the Seed view page.
* **Show Examples for a Derivation.** Displays requests and responses for keys and derivations. Available from the "Derive Key" page.

These functions allow developers to test `ur` interactions with other wallets, by providing the QR they would use to request a seed and also displaying the QR response, so that they can double-check their work.

## Using a Seed

The main power of **Gordian Seed Tool** is that you can permanently store your seeds there, and instead give out keys or otherwise answer requests, as needed.

### Answering Seed Requests

The Blockchain Commons [`ur:crypto-request`/`ur:crypto-response` system](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-001-request.md) specifies how one app can request a certain type of [UR-encoded data](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md) and another app can send that requested data. **Gordian Seed Tool** is integrated with this standard: another app can request a seed or a specific derived key, and **Gordian Seed Tool** will send it (with your approval).

This is accomplished via the **Scan** (qr code) feature. Select it and import a QR code through camera, Photos, or File, or else read in a `crypto-request` through the Clipboard. You will be told what seed or key is being requested, and you can choose to approve it. If you do, you'll then be given a QR code that you can scan into the other app as the `ur:crypto-response`. 

The biggest use of this function is to send a very specific derived key that the other app desires. Though Seed Tool lets you derive a few common kinds of keys from your seeds or to hand-enter less standard derivation paths, a `ur:crypto-request` allows another app access to _any_ key derived from your seed in a much simpler and more reliable fashion.

        <br><div align="center"><b>Key Request</b></div>
      </center></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


### Deriving a Key

If you want to use Seed Tool to derive a key without using a `ur:crypto-request`, you can do so by selecting a seed, choosing to "Authenticate" the "Encrypted Data", and then clicking the "Derive Key" button. The "Other Key Derivations" option will allow you to derive the public and private Bitcoin keys on testnet or mainnet for: Master Keys, Cosigner keys (48'/0'/0'/2' for mainnet or 48'/1'/0'/2 for testnet), or Segwit keys (84'/0'/0' for mainnet or 84'/1'/0' for testnet). Simply click the "Derivation Preset" that you prefer. You can also enter a "Custom" Bitcoin derivation by hand by editing the key path. 

Alternatively, you can derive Master Keys for Ethereum.

The seed view page also contains quick buttons that just say "Cosigner Public Key" (at the top) and "Cosigner Private Key" (under the "Derive Key" button in the Encrypted Data). They derive a public or private Bitcoin Cosigner Key, using either mainnet or testnet, as recorded in your **Settings**.

After deriving a key, you can export it by using a QR code or sharing the text of the `ur:crypto-hdkey` or the text of the Base58 encoding (`xprv` for traditional keys, `zprv` for segwit keys). For sharing text, see more in "Using Share Sheets" below.

<div align="center">

        <br><div align="center"><b>Ethereum Derivation</b></div>
      </center></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

Whenever you derive a key, you will be given a visual cue to remind you how much security is required by the key: export options for private keys appear in orange, while export options for public keys appear in green.

### Sharding a Seed

SSKR sharding allow you to make a backup of your key that's not easily susceptible to attacks. You shard your key, you give out the shares to friends and family, and then if you ever lose your key you can reconstruct it by recovering a threshold of shares.

To create SSKR shares of your seed, go to the seed view, "Authenticate" to access your "Encrypted Data" and choose "Backup". Then select the "Backup as SSKR Multi-Share" option. This will allow you to set a number of groups, a number os shares, and thresholds You will usually leave the groups at one and just choose a number of shares (such as 3) and a threshold required to recover the seed (such as 2). 

You can also choose a more complex methodology with SSKR's "groups", which allows you to define multiple groups, then to set a threshold of a certain number of shares from a certain number of groups: for example, you could create 3 groups, with a group threshold of 2, then have each group include 3 shares, with a threshold of 2. You'd then be able to recover your seed from 4 of the 9 shares, as long as 2 each come from 2 different groups. (But, this is more complex than most people will need: just do something simple like a 2 of 3 sharding or a 3 of 5 sharding if the group sharding sounds like something you wouldn't know how to use).

A number of default presets will probably suit you needs:

* **1 of 1:** A method for backing up your seed using just one share. It's very similar to backing up the Bytewords for the seed.
* **2 of 3:** Use this if you're not sure: it's probably the most common methodology. Place your three shares in three locations (or with three people) and then reconstruct by recovering two of them.
* **3 of 5:** An expansion of 2-of-3. If you've got more locations where you can store keys, or more friends, or both, or if you're a little less certain of the continued availability of any individual place or person, use this.
* **4 of 9:** A very large-scale sharding. This is most likely to be used in a corporate environment where different shares are kept by different personnel, but it could also be used by someone with a very large group of trusted friends.
* **2 of 3 - 2 of 3:** A complex "groups" situation where you need two shares from two groups to recover. It may be more secure than a straight 4 of 9 because you can partition your keys to different groups of people to ensure that you can always recover and they can never collude.

A [Scenario Guide for SSKR Shares](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md) explains more about why to use a particular scenario and how to get the best use of it. But, again, if that's too much, just use a 2-of-3 and make sure that each of the shares is separated physically from the others.

When you export your shards, you can share them as Bytewords (which are human-readable words) or `ur:crypto-sskr` (which are specially formatted URs that can be easily and reliably  read into any apps following the UR specification). (For more on sharing, see "Using Share Sheets" below.) However, the most useful means to export your SSKR may be by printing them. After you print them, you can cut out strips of paper for each share and then hand them to the people who will be storing them. We suggest asking them to store the QR code in [**Gordian QR Tool**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070) and then to thoroughly destroy the slip of paper.

Be sure that anyone receiving shares knows to return them only after receiving live visual or voice confirmation from you, and to send them via an encrypted channel, such as Signal. An in-person meeting is even better, because it resolves most threats that come about through the reconstruction of a seed. See [The Dangers of Secret-Sharing Schemes](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Dangers.md) for why this is important.

### 2FAing Your Requests

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/master/images/st-2fa.jpeg"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/master/images/st-2fa.jpeg" align="right" width=250 style="border:1px solid black;"></a>
Any time you request private data, such as your seed or private keys derived from your seed, **Gordian Seed Tool's** 2FA will go into effect.

The first factor was entered by you when you logged into your Apple ID the first time that you used **Seed Tool.**

The second factor is applied whenever you access private data, most frequently by choosing to "Authenticate" to access your Encrypted Data. Usually, you will enter a thumbprint, but on a newer iPhone you will use Face ID and on most Mac systems you will enter a password. 

This ensures that even if someone acquires your device in an unlocked mode, they won't be able to get to your seed data.

## Exporting a Seed

You should be able to safely and securely use your seed within **Gordian Seed Tool** by responding to `ur:crypto-requests` and vy deriving keys. However, if you want to some day export the whole seed, you can.

A seed can be exported by touching the "Authenticate" box under the "Encrypted Data" section of a seed. This will, as usual, require your 2FA. After it decrypts, you can then click the "Share" button. This will allow you to share as hex, as BIP39 Mnemonic Words, as ByteWords, or as a `ur:crypto-seed`. 

**Human-Readable Exports:**
* **BIP39 Mnemonic Words:** The mostly widely used human-readable specification. Use this as a backup if you might need to later import it to an older wallet.
* **ByteWords:** Blockchain Commons' human-readable specification. It was constructed to maximize the ability to remember the words and to minimize the ability to confuse them. This is a preferred backup method if you'll later be importing into a modern wallet, such as a Gordian app.

**Computer-Readable Exports:**
* **Hex:** The mostly widely used computer-readable specification. Use this is you plan to export to an older wallet.
* **`ur:crypto-seed`:** Blockchain Commons' computer-readable specification. This is the best export method for modern wallets that support Uniform Resources, including Gordian apps, because it will also preserve metadata such as data of creation and notes.

These functions will all allow you to share your data as described in "Using Share Sheets", below.

> :warning: **WARNING:** Generally, you want to always keep your seeds in **Seed Tool**. A seed is both secure and resilient in the app. There is no reason to export it. Instead, export keys as appropriate, ideally watch-only public keys or specific derived keys in response to a `ur:crypto-request` from another app.

### Using Share Sheets

Sharing for derived keys, SSKR shares, and seeds occurs via Share Sheets. This means that you can share them via a variety of standard methodologies, such as Airdrop, Messages, Mail, and other apps that offer sharing capabilities. We suggest sharing via an encrypted app, such as Signal.

## Deleting a Seed

If you're done with a seed or if you've exported it to another app or device, you may then want to delete it.

Seeds can be deleted with the "Edit" function on the main page. You can immediately "Undo" it if you deleted the wrong seed, but as soon as you make any other change (such as adding a new seed or even resorting your seeds), any seed you deleted will be gone forever. Be careful!

You can also remove all seeds, including those in iCloud, with the "Erase All Data" buttin in the Settings menu.

## Integrating with Ethereum

If you use seeds with Ethereum instead of Bitcoin, you can set that as your default view by choosing "Ethereum" as your "Primary Asset" under **Settings**.

This will cause some changes in functionality.

### Viewing a Seed

When you "View a Seed", you will see a new option for "Ethereum Address", which will reveal the Ethereum address associated with the seed.

### Exporting a Seed

When you choose to "Derive Key" from a Seed after you "Authenticate", you will see new options related to Ethereum.

1. Deriving an "Ethereum Private Key" will provide the standard Ethereum Private Key.
2. Choosing "Other Key Derivations" will allow you to derive a "Master Key" or a "44'/60'/0'/0/0" derived key for Ethereum. Each choice will depict four options: Ethereum Private Key, Ethereum Address, Private HD Key, and Public HD Key.

### Reading the Blockies

For the Ethereum Private Key and Address, the "blockie" associated with the address is shown rather than a Lifehash. This is a [widely used specification](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethereum-blockies) that much like Lifehash provides a visual representation, but in the case of the blockie, it is always associated with the Ethereum address.

## Appendix I: Threat Modeling

**Gordian Seed Tool** is built on a standard [#SmartCustody threat model](https://www.smartcustody.com/): the Gordian reference applications prioritize the management of risks and adversaries based on our assessment of the ones most likely to affect an average or sophisticated user in a first-world country. It focuses on the following #SmartCustody adversary categories:

* **Loss by Mistakes.** Making mistakes, particularly losing keys or seeds, is likely the main source of digital-asset loss for independent users. **Seed Tool** is thus all about resilience: protecting your keys from loss.
* **Loss by Acts of God.** The resilience of **Seed Tool** will also protect your seeds from many natural disasters, because they can be restored if your computing device is lost.
* **Loss by Theft.** There are many ways that your keys could be stolen, though these problems are more likely to affect large institutions. Nonetheless, **Seed Tool** helps to protect you against _external_ theft, particularly Network Attacks, by keeping your seeds in a closely held device. This does not include _internal_ theft, including Institutional Theft, which is discussed below.
* **Privacy-Related Problems.** **Seed Tool** gives some attention to privacy-related problems, as knowledge of your funds is protected by the app itself.

We have explicitly chosen "Loss by Institutional Theft" and "Loss by Government" as categories that we do not additionally guard against.

* **Loss by Institutional Theft.** To be specific, we trust the platform, which is currently Apple. We believe that their methods of encryption are not just secure, but also have a lower chance of systemic compromise than something that we might hand code. We additionally believe that their incentives for maintaining that security are much higher than any incentives to purposefully break it — and that they've proven that in the past through stand-offs with spy agencies.
* **Loss by Government.** Though we don't necessarily trust the government, we do believe that digital assets would be the least of one's problems if a government were acting against an individual. We say this with a caveat: our risk model presumes a law-abiding non-authoritarian government. That means that our risk model, and thus our reference apps, may not be secure in an authoritarian regime, such as in China where [Apple has been required to store iCloud data within the country](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/apple/apples-icloud-china-set-move-state-controlled-data-center), making them vulnerable to covert or overt seizure.

Usage of specific features could cause the activation of other threats:

* **Loss through Convenience.** We have chosen some features that introduce a Convenience threat, where we potentially decrease the security of **Seed Tool** in order to increase its usability. This comes about through the use of the Clipboard to transmit key material. We consider this a minor threat as other apps can read the Clipboard; with Universal Clipboard enabled, this can even be the case for apps on your other machines logged in to the same iCloud account. Similarly, the share sheets allow sharing via methodologies that may not be secure, such as Mail and Messages. If you consider Clipboard a larger threat, do not use it to import key material, instead depending on hand entry or use of the Camera. When sharing via the share sheets, you should use methods that are encrypted and safe, such as Signal.
* **Loss through Personal Network Attack.** The gathering of shares to reconstruct a seed _always_ represents a threat where someone might steal and use your seed before or as you reconstructed, as discussed in [The Dangers of Secret-Sharing Schemes](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Dangers.md). An adversary could intercept your shares as they're being returned (so use an encrypted channel, or do it in person), and an adversary could compromise the computer where you're reconstructing the seed (so do it on an offline device, if possible).
  
## Appendix II: Other Tools

Power users may wish to use our command-line tools for manipulating seeds.
